        This application is designed to help identify different types of skin lesions using deep learning technology. It provides a simple interface for uploading images and receiving quick assessments.
        
        ### Purpose
        
        Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, and early detection is crucial for successful treatment. This tool aims to assist in the preliminary assessment of skin lesions, potentially helping to identify concerning cases that should be examined by healthcare professionals.
        
        ### The Model
        
        The classification model was developed using deep learning techniques and trained on a dataset of dermatological images. While it can provide useful insights, it should be used as a supplementary tool only and not as a replacement for professional medical advice.
        
        ### Classes
        
        The model can distinguish between three types of skin lesions:
        
        1. **Dermatofibroma** - A common benign skin nodule that usually appears on the legs
        2. **Melanocytic nevus** - Commonly known as a mole, these are typically benign growths
        3. **Melanoma** - A serious form of skin cancer that requires prompt medical attention
        
        ### Important Disclaimer
        
        This application is intended for educational and research purposes only. It is not a medical device and has not been approved for clinical use. Always consult with a qualified healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment of skin conditions.

        st.title("How It Works")
        st.markdown("""
        ### The Process
        
        This skin lesion classifier works through a series of steps:
        
        1. **Image Capture/Upload**: You provide an image of a skin lesion either by uploading a photo or taking one with your camera.
        
        2. **Preprocessing**: The image is automatically resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized to prepare it for analysis.
        
        3. **Classification**: The deep learning model processes the image and assigns probabilities to each possible class.
        
        4. **Visualization**: The results are displayed with a probability distribution and a heatmap showing which regions of the image influenced the decision.
        
        ### The Technology
        
        The system uses a deep convolutional neural network trained on thousands of dermatological images. The model has learned to identify visual patterns associated with different types of skin lesions.
        
        ### Interpreting Results
        
        When viewing your results, consider:
        
        - **Confidence Score**: Higher percentages indicate greater confidence in the prediction
        - **Probability Distribution**: Shows how the model allocated probability across all possible classes
        - **Heatmap**: Highlights regions of interest that influenced the model's decision
        
        Remember that even high-confidence predictions should be confirmed by a healthcare professional, especially if the lesion is classified as potentially malignant.

        ### Frequently Asked Questions
        
        **Q: How accurate is this tool?**  
        A: While the model has been trained on a diverse dataset, it should be used as a supportive tool and not for definitive diagnosis. Always consult with a medical professional.
        
        **Q: What types of images work best?**  
        A: Clear, well-lit images of the skin lesion taken from directly above work best. The lesion should be centered in the image with some surrounding normal skin visible.
        
        **Q: Is my data private?**  
        A: Yes, all processing is done locally in your browser. Images are not stored or sent to external servers.
        
        **Q: What should I do if the model identifies a potential melanoma?**  
        A: If the model indicates a high probability of melanoma, consult with a dermatologist immediately. Early detection of melanoma significantly improves treatment outcomes.
        
        ### Tips for Better Results
        
        1. **Good Lighting**: Take photos in bright, natural light if possible
        2. **Clear Focus**: Ensure the image is sharp and not blurry
        3. **Proper Distance**: Capture the lesion from about 10-15 cm away
        4. **Context**: Include some surrounding skin for reference
        5. **Multiple Angles**: If uncertain, take photos from different angles
